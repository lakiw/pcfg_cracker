"""
Tries to detect Multi-words in the training dataset

Aka CorrectBatteryStaple = Correct Battery Staple

There's multiple ways to do this.
For example https://github.com/s3inlc/CorrectStaple

The current method attempts to learn multiwords from the training set
directly, with a small list of assist multi words to aid in this.

Aka if 'cat' and 'dog' is seen multiple times in the training set
but 'catdog' is only seen once, attempt to break it into a multi-word

        One "weird" note about the lookup table. To speed things up, I'm not

        table. Therefore there will almost certainly be one, two character strings
        in the lookup table that aren't valid base words. That's ok though since
        their "count" wont' be recorded so they will not be treated as valid
        base words, and since they are short and most will be parts of other
        words, they shouldn't take up a lot of space
