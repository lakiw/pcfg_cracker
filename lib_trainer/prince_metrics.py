"""
This file contains logic for extracting data that will be useful for
generating wordlists to use in an optimized PRINCE guessing session

Note: While PRINCE is not a PCFG based guess generator, the data generated
by this trainer can be useful for supporting other attack modes

Note 2: This is mostly a placeholder as all it does now is update the
count_prince Counter with each parsed section. The plan is eventually to
add additional logic in here that may be useful for optimizing a PRINCE
dictionary. For example, certain objects may be weighted to make them more or
less likely.
